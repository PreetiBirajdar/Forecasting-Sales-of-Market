Forecasting Sales of Market
This project focuses on forecasting sales in the market using data analysis and visualization techniques in Google Colab. The objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that can accurately forecast future sales based on historical sales data and other relevant factors. By leveraging the data analysis and visualization capabilities of Google Colab, we aim to provide valuable insights into market trends, seasonality, and potential future sales performance.

Project Overview
In this project, we explore a dataset of historical market sales data, which includes information such as sales volume, dates, product categories, ship mode, sub categories and other relevant factors. The dataset serves as a valuable resource for conducting in-depth analysis, visualization, and sales forecasting


Objectives
The main objectives of this project are as follows:
1. Understand and analyze the market sales dataset, including its features and target variable.
2. Preprocess and clean the dataset, handling missing values, outliers, and transforming data as necessary.
3. Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the historical sales trends, seasonality, and other patterns.
4. Apply data visualization techniques to visualize the sales data and identify key patterns, trends, and relationships.
